# OCaml Ray Tracer
By Aaron Fritz

OCaml is the parent language of F#, and between the two of them, I would say I prefer the latter to be honest. OCaml's type system is very strong and expressive, but these days its most common compiler implementation is lagging behind others due to it lack of certain features like multi-threading. However, its native code generator is one feature it has over the leading F# implementation, so that's one reason why I have interest writing OCaml code.

Written with Visual Studio 2017 and compiled with ocamlopt in Cygwin. The program outputs a 720p .PPM image that can be converted to another format like PNG.
